RFID 
RFID or Radio Frequency Identification is a method in which electromagnetic waves are used for transmitting data for the purpose of identifying tags attached to objects. An RFID system consists of a transmitter (tag) and a reader.The tag is encrypted with a unique code and the reader scans this code for the identification purpose. The tags are generally of two types: active and passive. Active tags have a battery fitted to it and it transmits the unique code periodically or in the proximity of the reader. Passive tags are powered using the electromagnetic induction from the signal transmitted by the reader. Typical applications of RFID are access control systems, ID cards, human identification, animal identification, payment systems, tagging books, replacing bar codes, tagging merchandise in stores etc . RFID tags are available in different shapes but the most common shape is in the form of a card. The RFID readers are available in the market in the form of a module with all the supporting hardware. This article is about interfacing  RFID to 8051 microcontroller.
